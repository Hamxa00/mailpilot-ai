What MailPilot AI is not
- Not a noisy feature silo. It does not flood your screen with options you never use.
- Not a heavy desktop app that drains battery or memory for trivial tasks.
- Not a data hoarder. It follows a privacy-conscious model that you can tune.
- Not a closed ecosystem. It is open source, with clear paths to customization, contribution, and independent auditing.

Core ideas and value
- Minimalist design: A calm, distraction-free workspace that lets you read, compose, and act on email with minimal friction.
- AI assistance that respects your pace: AI helps draft replies, summarize long threads, and surface relevant information, but you stay in control.
- Focus where it matters: The UI guides you to the essential actions first, with optional AI-powered enhancements that can be enabled or disabled.
- Smooth integration: Direct access to Gmail via the official API, so you can work with your real inbox without leaving the app.
- Open source and accessible: The code is transparent, auditable, and ready for contributions from developers, designers, and researchers.

Features at a glance
- Clean inbox view: A distraction-free layout that highlights essential content, nudges, and actions without overwhelming visuals.
- AI-assisted drafting: Create polished replies quickly with AI-generated drafts that you can edit or send as-is.
- Smart summarization: Long email threads are summarized so you can catch up fast.
- Intent-aware triage: AI helps classify emails by urgency, topic, and required action, so you know what to tackle first.
- Context-aware search: Find messages by speaker, date, project, or topic, with quick filters and saved searches.
- Gmail API integration: Seamless access to your Gmail data through Google’s official API, with safe authentication flows.
- Keyboard-first interactions: A lean set of shortcuts to power your workflow.
- Theming and accessibility: High-contrast options, adjustable font sizes, and modular UI that adapts to your needs.
- Offline support for core tasks: Basic reading and drafting can work with limited network access.
- Open source: The codebase is open for inspection, improvement, and collaboration.

How it works under the hood
- Client side: Built with Next.js and a modern React UI scaffold using a streamlined component system (Shadcn UI-inspired patterns) for fast, accessible rendering.
- AI layer: Optional AI features leverage a configurable AI service. You can use local inference if you provide a compatible model, or a hosted API, e.g., OpenAI-like services, depending on your setup.
- Data flow: Gmail API provides message data and thread context. The app processes content in the client and, if enabled, sends text to an AI service for drafting or summarization. The UI renders results and allows you to act on them.
- Security model: Credentials are stored securely (in the environment or OS keychain, never in plain text). Access tokens are scoped to Gmail data and are revoked if you revoke permissions.
- Extensibility: The architecture is modular. You can swap AI providers, add new UI screens, or plug in additional Gmail features as needed.
